    <h2>What's this?</h2>
    <p>
A network of sites connected together by Maybe Logic!
This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring">webring</a> was first forged in celebration of <a href="https://www.maybeday.net/">Maybe Day 2022.</a>
Updated in 2025 to prioritize the circular functionality of the ring, removing sites without navigation links. 
    </p>

    <h2>How to join</h2>
    <p>
To join the New Trajectories Webring, send an email to <a href="mailto:weirdoverse@gmail.com">weirdoverse@gmail.com</a> with your site link, name, and an RSS feed (if one is available) 
    </p>

    <h2>Add the banner</h2>
    <p>
        Once you've joined the ring, copy this code snippet into your site:
    </p>

    {% highlight 'html' %}{% include 'snippet.njk' %}{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
        It will render this banner that links to the other members:
    </p>

    {% include 'snippet.njk' %}

    <p>
        Of course, you can also make your own banner or just statically link to the next / previous people in the ring. This is just a default option that could work well for most people.
